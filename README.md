# Barry Brooke HOA

## Website Goals (min. viable product)
1. **General introduction** (landing page)
2. **Allow members to access documents online** (do we want to require residents to create an account and log in to view documents?)
3. **View brief bios of HOA board members**
4. **Allow online payment of HOA dues** (do we want to require residents to create an account before making a payment?)
  - Should residents see a history of their past payments?
  - Can we leverage a third party for this? We accept their name, payment info, and validate through third-party
  - Should we allow recurring payments? (set it once and it will auto-pay annually)

## Other Ideas (extra)
- **Community Calendar** (widget, third-party - Google?)
- **News Portal** (updates on what's happening in the HOA), similar to a blog
- **Contact Form** (allow contact through form on website rather than just email link)

## What We Need (cost of operations)
- **Domain** (barrybrookehoa.com is available) - rough estimate **$15.00**, this would be a recurring fee (annually, price may vary year to year)
- **Hosting** - pricing would be a recurring fee (annually, price may vary year to year)
  - Vercel (recommended, Pro is $20.00/mo), we _could_ get by with the free version and still tie to our custom domain
- **Website** (free, no-cost)

Rough total cost of maintenance (domain and hosting) per year:
**$255.00 annually**
This would increase HOA dues **$2.14/household** or use built-up savings
OR
We only purchase the domain for **$12.00-$15.00 annually**

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

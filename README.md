# Barry Brooke HOA

## Website Goals (min. viable product)
1. **General introduction** (landing page)
2. **Allow members to access documents online**
3. **View brief bios of HOA board members**

## Other Ideas (extra)
- **Community Calendar** (widget, third-party - Google?)
- **News Portal** (updates on what's happening in the HOA), similar to a blog
- **Contact Form** (allow contact through form on website rather than just email link)
- **Allow online payment of HOA dues** (do we want to require residents to create an account before making a payment?)
  - Should residents see a history of their past payments?
  - Can we leverage a third party for this? We accept their name, payment info, and validate through third-party
  - Should we allow recurring payments? (set it once and it will auto-pay annually)

## Tech Stack
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
